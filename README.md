# Drift_Detection_Machine_Learning
The Kalman filter is a recursive mathematical algorithm used to estimate the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements. In the context of drift detection, the Kalman filter can be employed to track the evolving distribution of data over time and detect when significant changes or drifts occur.
